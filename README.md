# Setup Development Environment
We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#intro) to ensure quality of code. This is automatically installed with the requirements and should warn you if you are commiting dysfunctional code. Our pre-commit checks also if you are using [Python typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
